# Installation

The installation of SubredditLog described here requires [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) 
and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). While 
[Podman](https://podman.io/) and [podman-compose](https://github.com/containers/podman-compose) _may_ work,
they are currently untested and unsupported.

The following sections describe how to set up a new instance of SubredditLog:

1. [Compose Stack](1-compose.md)
2. [HTTP server](2-http.md)
