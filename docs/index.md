# What is SubredditLog?

SubredditLog is an open-source web application designed to help record and document moderator activities on
a [subreddit](https://nealschaffer.com/subreddit/). The idea was conceived by a few of the moderators at 
[/r/lfg](https://www.reddit.com/r/lfg) and was brought into existence by the author in order to be used by 
moderators of _any_ subreddit.

It is intended to replace Google Sheets, dedicated Discord channels, or any other unstructured means of 
recording moderator activity.

## Why Use It?

Having a valid, permanent log aids in making moderation decisions. The built-in moderation log only goes 
back so far and doesn't allow for notes nor the logging of warnings.

- The user who is breaking rules right now? The log shows they did it two months ago, as well, and now 
they're right back at it after their ban was finished.
- That post you're not sure about? The user has been warned four times previously.

This type of information can _easily_ be found via SubredditLog.

## Getting Started

See the [installation guide](installation/index.md) for help getting SubredditLog up and running.
